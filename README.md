# JavaScript DSA Practice

This folder contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.

I'm starting with the **very basics** and taking it one step forward every day — building consistency, clarity, and confidence in solving problems.


### Focus Areas

* Arrays and Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Trees and Graphs
* Recursion and Backtracking
* Sorting and Searching
* Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum
* Hash Maps and Sets


### Approach

* Solve 1–2 problems daily
* Begin with fundamentals, gradually move to patterns and optimization
* Write clean, readable code with comments where needed
* Understand time and space complexity
* Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) to write concise solutions


This isn’t about rushing — it’s about showing up daily and solving with clarity.
One problem at a time. One level up each day.
